My name is Yanfeng Tan, and I am an M.S. student in the EC79 (Computer Engineering) program at UC San Diego. I am planning to take gap quarters for Winter 2026 and Spring 2026, and then return to campus in Fall 2026. I have a few questions and would also like to double check my understanding regarding SEVIS, my F-1 status, visa, and future CPT/OPT eligibility.
1. Working from China during my gap quarters
• If I return to China during my Winter 2026 and Spring 2026 gap quarters and work for a company while I am physically in China, would I need CPT authorization for that employment?
• Are there any immigration or status-related concerns I should be aware of if I work remotely from China during my gap quarters?
2. SEVIS termination and new SEVIS ID / I-20
• My understanding is that if I take two consecutive gap quarters (Winter 2026 and Spring 2026), my current SEVIS record will be terminated, and when I return I will need a new SEVIS ID and a new Initial I-20. Could you please confirm if this understanding is correct?
• My current U.S. visa is only valid for one year. If I return in Fall 2026 on a new SEVIS ID / Initial I-20, does that mean I will need to apply for a new F-1 visa in China?
• If my new F-1 visa application were to be refused and I could not return to the U.S., are there any options from your perspective to defer my return or otherwise continue my program?
3. Timeline for requesting a new I-20 and SEVIS record (returning in Fall 2026)
• Assuming my gap quarters (Winter and Spring 2026) are approved and I plan to re-enroll in Fall 2026, what is the earliest time I can request a new Initial I-20 and new SEVIS record for my return?
• I would like to apply for a new visa as early as possible, so I want to make sure I understand when I can start the new I-20/SEVIS process.
4. Latest date to depart the U.S. after submitting a Gap Quarter Request
• From what I have read, after I submit the Gap Quarter Request in iServices for Winter and Spring 2026, in order to remain in status I must depart the U.S. by the earlier of (1) 15 days after submitting the request, or (2) the start of the next quarter. Could you please confirm if this interpretation is correct, or if there are any additional timing rules I should be aware of?
5. Future OPT/CPT eligibility after returning on a new SEVIS ID
Based on ECE’s LOA and program time limit rules, if I take gap quarters in Winter and Spring 2026 and then return on a new SEVIS ID in Fall 2026 as a full-time student, I expect that the earliest I could graduate would be the end of Spring 2027 (after three full-time quarters on the new SEVIS record: Fall 2026, Winter 2027, and Spring 2027).
• If I graduate in Spring 2027 after completing three full-time quarters on the new SEVIS ID, would I still be eligible to apply for post-completion OPT? My understanding is that I would meet the “one academic year (3 quarters)” requirement again on the new SEVIS record, but I would like to confirm this with you.
• Alternatively, if I choose to graduate later (for example, in Fall 2027 or Winter 2028), would I still be able to use CPT in Summer 2027, assuming by that time I have completed at least one academic year (3 full-time quarters) on the new SEVIS ID?

I understand that my situation involves both academic planning and immigration planning, and I want to be sure that I am following all F-1 regulations while planning my gap quarters, return quarter, and future work authorization. I would really appreciate your help in confirming whether my understanding above is correct.

Thank you very much for your time and guidance.
